# Java with Jiva

I have over 13 years of management experience, including managing large distributed teams across geographically diverse locations in Europe and the USA. My primary expertise is with Java Virtual Machine (JVM) teams at Oracle, Amazon, Twitter, and Apple. That said, most of my engineering life has been in systems with experience in operating systems, Kubernetes, and other platform infrastructure-related areas.

I'm a past contributor to the development of the Sun/Oracle HotSpot JVM compiler while working at Sun and AMD. In addition, I have submitted and been granted US Patents for code generation, virtualization, and graphics acceleration of code.

## How I work
My role within a team is to provide a safe place for each member to do their best work. Every voice should be heard, and feel comfortable being their best self. Conflicts are welcome, but in a healthy manner, focusing on the task at hand. When things go poorly, there is no blame, only paths forward.

## What I like to do
I'm passionate about the outdoors and will often be hiking in and around the Bay Area. Even my vacations are filled with hikes, including a desolate one in Iceland with no soul for as far as I could see. I'm also a fan of reading and often will have classic Sci-Fi novels from Asimov, Bear, and others on my Kindle.
