# About Azeem

I bring over 25 years of combined experience in software engineering and management, specializing in leading large, distributed teams across the US and Europe. My core expertise lies in **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)** development, having led teams at **Oracle, Amazon, Twitter, and Apple**.

Beyond the JVM, I have deep experience with Operating Systems design, Kubernetes, and platform infrastructure. Before moving into management, I was a hands-on contributor to the **Sun/Oracle HotSpot JVM compiler** at Sun and AMD, and I hold US Patents for code generation, virtualization, and graphics acceleration.

## How I work

My primary goal is to build a culture of **psychological safety** where every team member can do their best work. I believe that every voice should be heard and that authenticity drives performance.

I encourage healthy conflict focused on solving the problem at hand, rather than interpersonal friction. When challenges arise, I champion a **blameless culture** that focuses strictly on solutions and paths forward.

## What I like to do

I am passionate about the outdoors and spend my free time hiking the trails in and around the Bay Area. My vacations are often centered on remote wilderness—most recently, a solitary trek through the pristine landscapes of Iceland. When I’m not hiking, you can find me immersed in classic Sci-Fi novels.
